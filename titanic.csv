# Description:
#
#      This data set provides information on the fate of passengers on
#      the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner ‘Titanic’, summarized
#      according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival.
#
# Details:
#
#      The sinking of the Titanic is a famous event, and new books are
#      still being published about it.  Many well-known facts-from the
#      proportions of first-class passengers to the ‘women and children
#      first’ policy, and the fact that that policy was not entirely
#      successful in saving the women and children in the third class-are
#      reflected in the survival rates for various classes of passenger.
#
#      These data were originally collected by the British Board of Trade
#      in their investigation of the sinking.  Note that there is not
#      complete agreement among primary sources as to the exact numbers
#      on board, rescued, or lost.
#
#      Due in particular to the very successful film ‘Titanic’, the last
#      years saw a rise in public interest in the Titanic.  Very detailed
#      data about the passengers is now available on the Internet, at
#      sites such as _Encyclopedia Titanica_ (<URL:
#      http://www.rmplc.co.uk/eduweb/sites/phind>).
