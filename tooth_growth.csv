# The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs
#
# Description:
#
#      The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for
#      tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs.  Each animal received one of
#      three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of
#      two delivery methods, (orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of
#      vitamin C and coded as ‘VC’).
#
# Usage:
#
#      ToothGrowth
#
# Format:
#
#      A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables.
#
#        [,1]  len   numeric  Tooth length
#        [,2]  supp  factor   Supplement type (VC or OJ).
#        [,3]  dose  numeric  Dose in milligrams/day
